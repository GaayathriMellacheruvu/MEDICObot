3. re (verify set of strings and match it)
4.IPython.display (used in diet module of the  program)

EMERGENCY:
The emergency module is an option for when you are in a life and death situation and are in no position to call for help.
 As soon as the module is picked, the user will be asked if its truly an emergency . If the answer is yes , an uninterruptable audio will be played to call for attention of a passerby.
If the answer is no , the user will be redirected back to the options screen.

          1.symptoms
          2.reports scanner
          3.BMI
Symptoms: upon choosing this option , the person would be asked a  series of multiple choice questions regarding the patient and condition ,and would be recommended a  doctor(oncologist ,dermatologist , etc.)based on the responses received.
Reports scanner: this would scan numerical data related reports and convert the image to text and then take in the values . after taking the values , it will check whether they fall in healthy ranges , and store the ones that donâ€™t , and then calculate the deficiencies and excesses . After calculating , the condition is displayed(this condition can be copy pasted in the diet column and a diet can be charted).
BMI: this would calculate the body mass index from inputs of height and weight, and compare with the ranges and calculate if the person is underweight or overweight.
